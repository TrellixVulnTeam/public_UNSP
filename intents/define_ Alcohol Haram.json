Therefore, in view of the religions, it is necessary to declare something unlawful if found intoxicant, and whatever thing is intoxicant should be unlawful. So, it has been mentioned in the hadith: \n(3645) Things which intoxicate in much quantity their little quantity are also haram.\n\nThe bad effect on drinking is that drunken quarrels with people abuse them and creates a disturbance."
